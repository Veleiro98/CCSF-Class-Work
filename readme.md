My Programming ClMy Programming Class Projects
This repository serves as a collection of projects, assignments, and code examples from my various programming classes. It reflects my learning journey and practical application of concepts in different programming languages.

Repository Contents
This repository is organized by programming language, with each top-level folder containing the associated projects and files:

Java/: Contains projects and assignments primarily written in Java. This includes (but is not limited to) console applications, object-oriented programming exercises, and data structure implementations.
Python/: Holds Python-based projects, which may cover scripting, data analysis tasks, or algorithm implementations.
This folder has little to no contents as of now, but there are plans to add more in the future.
Key Learning Areas Demonstrated
These projects collectively showcase my experience with:

Core Programming Concepts: Variables, data types, control flow (loops, conditionals), functions/methods.
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation.
Data Structures & Algorithms: Arrays, lists, stacks, queues, trees, sorting, searching (specific examples within projects).
Problem Solving: Approaches to breaking down problems and designing logical solutions.
Syntax and Idioms: Practical application of syntax and common patterns in Java, Python, and other languages.
How to Navigate
Each language folder generally contains subfolders for individual projects or assignments. Within each project folder, you'll typically find:

.java, .py, etc., source code files.
Any necessary input/output files or resources.
(Occasionally) brief project descriptions or problem statements, where available.
Getting Started (Optional - for runnable projects)
To run any of the code, you'll need the appropriate compiler/interpreter installed for the respective language (e.g., Java Development Kit for Java files, Python interpreter for Python files).

For Java projects: You can often compile and run .java files from your terminal using javac <FileName>.java and java <FileName>.
For Python projects: You can run .py files using python <FileName>.py.
